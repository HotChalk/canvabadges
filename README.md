Badges
---------------------------
This is an LTI-enabled service that allows you to award badges
(Mozilla Open Badges, specifically) to students in a course
based on their accomplishments in the course. Currently this
will will only work with Canvas.

Canvabadges now supports multiple badges per course, and has better
support for launching from multiple courses in the same session.
